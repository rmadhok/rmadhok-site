Welcome to my academic website. I am a PhD Candidate in the Food and Resource Economics Department at the [Faculty of Land and Food Systems](https://www.landfood.ubc.ca/), University of British Columbia. My research intersects environmental and development economics. I am a member of the [Centre for Food, Resource and Environmental Economics](https://cfree.landfood.ubc.ca/) (CFREE) and the [Wildlife and Conservation Economics Laboratory](http://wildconsecon.landfood.ubc.ca/). 

Broadly, I combine insights from economics and environmental science to study relationships between human activity and the environment. My current projects include recovering the economic value of biodiversity loss, estimating the cost of coal power plants on human health, and studying migration-induced labour-capital substitution. My geographic focus is mainly India.

Before my PhD studies, I was an [EPoD](https://epod.cid.harvard.edu/) pre-doctoral fellow at Harvard University, completed an M.A. Economics at UBC, and was a Research Associate at [J-PAL South Asia](https://www.povertyactionlab.org/south-asia).
