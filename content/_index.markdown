I am a PhD Candidate in the Food and Resource Economics Group at the Faculty of Land and Food Systems, University of British Columbia. My research spans environmental and development economics.\
**I am on the 2022/23 job market.**

You can find my CV [here](/pdf/rmadhok_cv.pdf).

My job market paper studies the extent to which economic development drives biodiversity loss in India. I document a substantial development-biodiversity tradeoff, and show that the tradeoff is largely mitigated under bottom-up institutions compared to extractive institutions.

My other work studies structural change as well as the long-run environmental costs of coal power plants. I employ a mix of applied theory, modern empirical methods, and geospatial tools in my research. 

Before my PhD, I was an [EPoD](https://epod.cid.harvard.edu/) pre-doctoral fellow at Harvard University, completed an M.A. Economics at UBC, and was a Research Associate at [J-PAL South Asia](https://www.povertyactionlab.org/south-asia).
