**I am a Postdoctoral Fellow in the [Department of Applied Economics](https://apec.umn.edu/) at the University of Minnesota.** [Here](/pdf/rmadhok_cv.pdf) is my CV.

I am an environmental economist with research themes spanning development, agriculture, and political economy. My work studies how economic activity and institutions shape the environment. 

I completed my PhD and MA from the University of British Columbia, and my BA from McGill University. I was previously an [EPoD](https://epod.cid.harvard.edu/) fellow at Harvard and a Research Associate at [J-PAL South Asia](https://www.povertyactionlab.org/south-asia).
