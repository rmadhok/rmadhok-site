Welcome to my website. I am a 4th year PhD Student in the Food and Resource Economics Group at the [Faculty of Land and Food Systems](https://www.landfood.ubc.ca/), University of British Columbia. My research focus is at the intersection of environmental and development economics. I am a member of the [Centre for Food, Resource and Environmental Economics](https://cfree.landfood.ubc.ca/) (CFREE) and the [Wildlife and Conservation Economics Laboratory](http://wildconsecon.landfood.ubc.ca/). I study how ...

My current projects include recovering the economic value of biodiversity loss in India, estimating the indirect cost of coal power plants on human health, and determining how agricultural households respond to labour shortages induced by family migration. I generally use large datasets, often containing spatial information.  

Before my PhD studies, I was an [EPoD](https://epod.cid.harvard.edu/) pre-doctoral fellow at Harvard University, completed an M.A. Economics at UBC, and was a Research Associate at [J-PAL South Asia](https://www.povertyactionlab.org/south-asia).
