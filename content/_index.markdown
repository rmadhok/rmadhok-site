I am a PhD Candidate in the Food and Resource Economics Group at the Faculty of Land and Food Systems, University of British Columbia.\
**I am on the 2022-23 job market.** [Here](/pdf/rmadhok_cv.pdf) is my CV.

**My research spans environmental and development economics**. My [job market paper](/pdf/rmadhok_jmp_2022.pdf) studies the threat to biodiversity from infrastructure expansion and the role of decentralized institutions for mitigating the tradeoff. My [other work](/research/) studies [structural change and the organization of agriculture](/pdf/2022_rural_urban_agriculture.pdf) as well as the long-run health costs of coal power plants.

I have an MA Economics from UBC and a BA in Economics and Environmental Studies from McGill University. I was also an [EPoD](https://epod.cid.harvard.edu/) fellow at Harvard and a Research Associate at [J-PAL South Asia](https://www.povertyactionlab.org/south-asia).
