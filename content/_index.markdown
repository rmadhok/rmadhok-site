I am a PhD Candidate in Food and Resource Economics at the Faculty of Land and Food Systems, University of British Columbia.  
**In August 2023, I will join the Department of Applied Economics at the University of Minnesota as a postdoctoral fellow.** [Here](/pdf/rmadhok_cv.pdf) is my CV.

I am an environmental economist with research themes spanning development, agriculture, and political economy. My work studies how economic activity and institutions shape the environment.

**My research spans environmental and development economics**. My [job market paper](/pdf/rmadhok_jmp_2022.pdf) studies the threat to biodiversity from infrastructure expansion and the role of decentralized institutions for mitigating the tradeoff. My [other work](/research/) studies [structural change and the organization of agriculture](/pdf/2022_rural_urban_agriculture.pdf) as well as the [long-run health costs of coal power plants](/pdf/power_plants_india.pdf).

I have an MA Economics from UBC and a BA in Economics and Environmental Studies from McGill University. I was also an [EPoD](https://epod.cid.harvard.edu/) fellow at Harvard and a Research Associate at [J-PAL South Asia](https://www.povertyactionlab.org/south-asia).
