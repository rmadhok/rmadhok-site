Welcome to my academic website. I am a fifth year PhD Candidate in the Food and Resource Economics Group at the [Faculty of Land and Food Systems](https://www.landfood.ubc.ca/), University of British Columbia. My research intersects environmental and development economics. I am a member of the [Centre for Food, Resource and Environmental Economics](https://cfree.landfood.ubc.ca/) (CFREE) and the [Wildlife and Conservation Economics Lab](http://wildconsecon.landfood.ubc.ca/). I am also a Fellow at the [Center for India and South Asia Research](https://cisar.iar.ubc.ca/) at the UBC School of Public Policy and Global Affairs. 

Broadly, I combine insights from economics and environmental science to study relationships between human activity and the environment. Some of my current projects include estimating the development-biodiversity tradeoff, studying labour-capital substitution in agriculture, and estimating long-run costs of coal power plants on human health. My geographic focus is mainly India.

Before my PhD studies, I was an [EPoD](https://epod.cid.harvard.edu/) pre-doctoral fellow at Harvard University, completed an M.A. Economics at UBC, and was a Research Associate at [J-PAL South Asia](https://www.povertyactionlab.org/south-asia).
