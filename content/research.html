<ul>
<li><p><em>Abstract</em>: Biodiversity in the tropics is severely threatened by land use change. This paper studies
the extent to which infrastructure development degrades biodiversity in India and, secondly,
the role of local institutions in mitigating the tradeoff. Combining new data on infrastructure-driven deforestation with one million birdwatching diaries, and exploiting within-observer
travel for identification, I document a sizeable development-biodiversity tradeoff. Transport,
irrigation, resettlement camps, and mining projects account for 20% of national species loss.
The tradeoff is more than halved under institutions that include forest-dependent indigenous
groups in development planning. Informed consent is a key mechanism, underscoring the
importance of people-oriented approaches for balancing development and conservation.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>“Urbanization and the Re-organization of Agriculture”</strong> (<em>Email for Draft</em>)<br />
(with Frederik Noack, Mushfiq Mobarak, and Olivier Deschenes)</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Abstract</em>: This paper studies how food needs are met when labour moves from farms to cities. Using household micro data from India and exogenous variation in migration induced by urban income shocks, we document sharp declines in food production among migrant-sending households residing near cities. Surprisingly, these households do not substitute labour with capital-intensive production, nor do they adopt new agricultural machinery. Instead, they divest from agriculture altogether and cultivate less land. In contrast, we find that food production surges and technology modernizes in remote regions where households are unaffected by labour loss. These findings are consistent with a two-sector general equilibrium model in which the incidence of direct and indirect effects depend on the spatial organization of the economy. Counterfactual simulations show that over half of the aggregate food shortage driven by the labour channel is mitigated by indirect spatial spillovers.</li>

As we retreated to our dwellings in the “anthropause” of spring 2020, were the wildlife sightings in previously crowded spaces a reclamation of habitat, or a mere increase in detection? We leverage an increase in balcony birdwatching, a million eBird entries, and difference-in-difference techniques to test if urban avian species richness rose during India’s COVID-19 lockdown. Controlling for effort, birdwatchers in the 20 most populous cities observed a 16% increase in the number of species during lockdown. While human activity stopped overnight, and noise and visual pollution decreased soon after, increased species diversity was observed 1–2 weeks later; evidence that gradual population recovery, not better detection, underlay our results. We find at-risk, and rare, species among those reclaiming cities, implying that reducing human disturbance in urban areas can protect threatened species. Increased species diversity likely derives from a reduction in noise and air pollution associated with the lockdown, implying that urban planners should consider conservation co-benefits of urban policies when designing sustainable cities.

In Spring 2020, COVID-19 led to an unprecedented halt in public and economic life across the globe. In an otherwise tragic time, this provides a unique natural experiment to investigate the environmental impact of such a (temporary) ‘de-globalization’. Here, we estimate the medium-run impact of a battery of COVID-19 related lockdown measures on air quality across 162 countries, going beyond the existing short-run estimates from a limited number of countries. In doing so, we leverage a new dataset categorizing lockdown measures and tracking their implementation and release, extending to 31 August 2020. We find that domestic and international lockdown measures overall led to a decline in PM2.5 pollution by 45% and 35%, respectively. This substantial impact persists in the medium-run, even as lockdowns are lifted, there is, however, substantial heterogeneity across different types of lockdown measures, different countries, and different sources of pollution. We show that some country trajectories are much more appealing (with fewer COVID-19 casualties, less economic downturn and bigger pollution reductions) than others. Our results have important policy implications and highlight the potential to ‘build back better’ a sustainable economy where pollution can be curbed in a less economically costly way than during the COVID-19 pandemic.
