## Selected Works in Progress

* "Tribal Forest Rights and Firm Behaviour." (with Sabyasachi Das)

This paper studies how firms react to tribal forest rights. In 2008, India granted forest management rights to 200 million tribal individuals, including the right to informed consent with developers seeking to acquire tribal forestland. Using a novel firm-level panel and a difference-in-difference design, we find: i) firms acquire less land in tribal areas after the policy; 2) Total factor productivity increases, and; 3) large, unproductive firms are less affected by the policy. These results are consistent with a model of firm production with transaction costs for encroachment. To study conservation implications, we obtain deforestation permits awarded to developers and show that infrastructure-driven deforestation declines after the policy. Overall, our results imply that the policy was successful from a conservation standpoint. From a development standpoint, they imply that conservation policy is not necessarily anti-development but, rather, shifts the *composition* of economic activity toward larger industry.

This paper studies the role and extent of ethnic favouritism in environmental disaster relief. Using restricted-access data on government compensation for human-wildlife conflict in the Himalayas, we first show that tribal communities are more exposed to wildlife attacks, yet receive lower compensation than non-tribals. We then build a political economy model which shows that minority leaders target disaster aid to coethnics, undoing discrimination. We test the model using quasi-random variation in India's system for reserving political seats for tribal candidates. Matched difference-in-difference estimates show that the gap in payouts between tribal and non-tribal victims substantially narrows under mandated tribal leadership compared to the gap in places holding general elections. Our findings underscore the role of political representation for achieving environmental justice.
