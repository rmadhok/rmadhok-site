<p>Welcome to my website. I am a PhD Candidate in the Food and Resource Economics Group at the <a href="https://www.landfood.ubc.ca/">Faculty of Land and Food Systems</a>, University of British Columbia. My research spans environmental and development economics. I am a member of the <a href="https://cfree.landfood.ubc.ca/">Centre for Food, Resource and Environmental Economics</a> and the <a href="http://wildconsecon.landfood.ubc.ca/">Wildlife and Conservation Economics Lab</a>. I am also a Fellow at the <a href="https://cisar.iar.ubc.ca/">Center for India and South Asia Research</a> at the UBC School of Public Policy. Test.</p>
<p>I combine insights from economics and environmental science to study relationships between human activity and the environment. My current projects include estimating the development-biodiversity tradeoff, studying labour-capital substitution in agriculture, and estimating long-run costs of coal power plants on human health. My geographic focus is mainly India.</p>
<p>Before my PhD, I was an <a href="https://epod.cid.harvard.edu/">EPoD</a> pre-doctoral fellow at Harvard University, completed an M.A.Â Economics at UBC, and was a Research Associate at <a href="https://www.povertyactionlab.org/south-asia">J-PAL South Asia</a>.</p>
